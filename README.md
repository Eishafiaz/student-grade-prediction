## 📁 Dataset

📄 **student-mat.csv** — Contains demographic, social, and academic features of students.

🔗 Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- 🤖 **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor**
- 📈 **Linear Regression**

---

## 📊 Project Workflow

✔️ Handle missing values and outliers using IQR  
📊 Visualize data distributions with Seaborn & Matplotlib  
🔁 Encode categorical features using One-Hot Encoding  
✂️ Split dataset into training and testing sets (70/30)  
🧠 Train MLP and Linear Regression models  
📉 Evaluate with metrics: MSE, MAE, R²  
📌 Visualize and compare predictions  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install required libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-grade-prediction.git
```

2. **Run the script**:

```bash
python grade_prediction.py
```

---

## 📈 Sample Output

- 📍 Comparison of predicted vs actual grades  
- 📊 R² scores for both models  
- 📉 Visual scatter plots for model performance
