🎓 Student Grade Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project is part of my AI coursework and focuses on predicting students' final grades using machine learning models like MLP Regressor and Linear Regression. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and modeled to compare prediction accuracy.

📁 Dataset
student-mat.csv: Student performance dataset containing demographic, social, and academic features.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

🧠 Models Used
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor

Linear Regression

📊 Features & Workflow
Handle missing values and outliers

Data visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib

Encode categorical features using One-Hot Encoding

Train-test split (70/30)

Model training and evaluation (MSE, MAE, R²)

Final prediction visualization

📌 Requirements
Install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
🚀 How to Run
Clone this repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-grade-prediction.git
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python grade_prediction.py
📈 Sample Output
Comparison of predicted vs actual grades

R² scores for both models

Plots showing feature distributions and prediction scatter
